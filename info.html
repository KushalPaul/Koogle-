<h1>Here you will know about koogle</h1>
<br><p>Hello users nice to see you here. In this page you will be knowing about Koogle and how to use it. Actually it is not a search engine. It is a website that enables you search anything but the result will be shown in Google. But it is my hope that you will get the best result about what you had searched.</p>
<br><br>
<p>In this website there is no use of the Enter key. After typing the text or url click the button Koogle Search and then you will be displayed the output. In the images if you click then you will be displayed the goole images and from there you can do your work. There is also no use of search history but I think that this will not cause any problem for you. In the above there are many apps by clicking that one you will directly reach to the app's page without typing. I belief that you will enjoy and get familiar with it.</p>
